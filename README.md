# Distributed Computer Vision System using Microservices

## Project Description

This project implements a **Distributed Computer Vision System** using **Microservices** architecture. The system divides tasks like object detection, image classification, and video processing into separate services to enhance modularity and scalability. These services are containerized using **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** is used for orchestration, enabling easy scaling and fault tolerance. This project is designed for efficient real-time processing of images and videos in a scalable environment.

### Key Features:
- **Object Detection**: Detect objects in images or video streams.
- **Image Classification**: Classify images into predefined categories using deep learning models.
- **Video Processing**: Process video streams for real-time analytics and object tracking.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each task is encapsulated in its own microservice for better modularity and fault isolation.
- **Scalable & Fault-Tolerant**: Using **Kubernetes** to orchestrate and scale the microservices efficiently.
- **Dockerized Services**: Each service is packaged in a Docker container, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.
- **API Integration**: User-facing APIs are built with **Flask** to allow users to upload images or videos and receive processed results.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: The primary language for developing the backend logic.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to build the REST APIs for communication between the services and the user.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for real-time computer vision tasks like object detection, image processing, and video processing.
- **C++**: Used for high-performance components of the system, especially for video processing.
- **Docker**: Containerizes each service, making the system easily deployable and consistent across environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Used for container orchestration and scaling the system on demand.
- **Minikube**: A tool for running Kubernetes locally for testing purposes.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building machine learning models (if applicable for image classification and object detection).
- **AWS EC2 / Google Cloud**: Future plans for deployment in production environments with cloud scalability.
